What is an algorithm?
    - A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.

How do you improve?
    1. Devise a plan for solving problems. 
    2. Master common problem solving patterns.

Problem solving
    1. Understand the Problem
    2. Explore Concrete Examples
    3. Break it down
    4. Solve/Simplify
    5. Look back and refactor

1. Understand the problem
    1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
    2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
    3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
    4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage)
    5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

2. Explore Concrete Examples
    Explore Examples
    1.Start with simple examples
    2. Progress to More Complex Examples
    3. Explore Examples with Empty Inputs
    4, Explore Examples with invalid inputs

3. Break it Down
    1. Explicitly write out the steps you need to take. 

4. Solve/Simplify
    1.Solve the simpler problems
    2.Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do.
    3. Temporarily ignore that difficulty
    4. Write a simplified solution
    5. Then incorporate that difficulty back in
